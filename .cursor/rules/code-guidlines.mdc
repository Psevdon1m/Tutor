# General Principles
- Use Nuxt 3 with TypeScript for structure and maintainability.

- Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles to ensure clean, scalable code.

- Use Supabase as the backend, handling authentication, database storage, and real-time updates.

- Implement OpenAI API efficiently, ensuring response optimization and cost minimization.

- Ensure PWA compliance with offline support, installability, and push notifications.

- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and UI consistency.

# Nuxt 3 & TypeScript
- Use defineNuxtComponent, defineNuxtPlugin, and definePageMeta appropriately.

- Define all interfaces and types in a types directory for clarity.

- Use useFetch and server routes (server/api/) for data fetching and API integration.

- Ensure modular composition using composables (composables/) for reusable logic (e.g., authentication, subscriptions).

# Authentication & User Management
- Use Google Auth via Supabase with useSupabaseAuth() and Supabase OAuth providers.

- Store user preferences in Supabase tables (users, subscriptions, settings).

- Implement middleware (middleware/auth.ts) to protect authenticated routes.

# Subscription & Notifications
- Users select subjects from a predefined list (subjects table in Supabase).

- Allow users to set notification frequency (hourly, daily, weekly).

- Use Supabase Edge Functions or a cron job to trigger OpenAI-generated questions.

- Integrate push notifications via Web Push API or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).


# OpenAI API Integration
- Store user-selected subjects and generate relevant questions dynamically.

- Cache AI-generated questions in Supabase to avoid unnecessary API calls.

- Provide AI-generated detailed answers stored in Supabase for each question.

# PWA & Performance
- Ensure full PWA compliance (manifest.json, service workers).

- Use Nuxt Image for optimized media delivery.

- Implement lazy loading (lazy directive) and prefetching (nuxt-link with prefetch).

- Optimize API calls with caching mechanisms.
